# Navigating the KinomaJS Application Framework Source Code and Documentation

<p align="center"> <img src="http://kinoma.com/media/press-images/img/KinomaJS-sm.jpg" height="200" alt=""/></p>

> Note: In this document, 'KinomaJS' refers to the JavaScript application framework for embedded devices created by Kinoma, not the entire Kinoma software stack.

The source code for the KinomaJS application framework is contained in [kinomajs/kinoma/kpr](../kinoma/kpr). This document is an overview of what's there, complete with links to source code and documentation.

***

## Extensions

The [extensions](../kinoma/kpr/extensions) folder contains the source code for KinomaJS features related to network connectivity, including Wi-Fi configuration and a variety of network protocols.

### Network Protocols

KinomaJS has its own implementations of the following network protocols. Links in the **Protocol** column lead to the source code. The samples are part of our collection of [KinomaJS sample apps](https://github.com/Kinoma/KPR-examples).

## Libraries

The [libraries](../kinoma/kpr/libraries) folder contains several JavaScript libraries. Some are built-in to the platform, others must be added to the build path. The table below provides a description of each and links to the corresponding source code, documentation, and (where applicable) to samples that showcase them from our collection of [KinomaJS sample apps](https://github.com/Kinoma/KPR-examples).
