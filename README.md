# KinomaJS Open Source Build

## Overview

The build system for KinomaJS open source software supports building for Mac OS X, iOS, Android, Linux, and Windows targets. The build system runs on Mac OS X (Yosemite and later), Windows (7+) and Linux (Ubuntu 14.04). This document describes the host build environment required to build KinomaJS for each supported target platform, and the commands used to build an application.

KinomaJS applications are defined by a **manifest.json** file which contains the build options, a list of the extensions required by the application, and packaging instructions.

The **kprconfig6** tool generates build instructions from the application's **manifest.json** file. **kprconfig6** generates instructions for a command-line build for all targets, and an IDE project file for Windows, Mac OS X, and iOS.

The steps for building are:

1. Set-up your host build environment
2. Build the XS6 tools
3. Build your KinomaJS application

* * *

The host build environment is set-up on the computer used to perform the build.

 * Building KinomaJS for Mac OS X and iOS requires a **Mac OS X** build host.
 * Building KinomaJS for Android also requires a **Mac OS X** build host. 
 * Building KinomaJS for Linux (e.g. GTK destkop, Kinoma Create) requires a **Linux** build host.
 * Building KinomaJS for Windows requires a **Windows** build host.
 * Building KinomaJS for Element (MW302) requires a **Mac OS X** build host.

The host build environment is set up once. Instructions for setting up the host build environment for each target platform are below.

* * *

Once the host build environment is set-up, the next step is to build the XS6 tools. These tools interpret the **manifest.json** file that defines an application to generate build instructions. The XS6 tool used to build applications is **kprconfig6**.

* * *

## Using kprconfig6

To invoke **kprconfig6** to build a KinomaJS application:

    kprconfig6 -x -m -p <platform> <path-to-manifest.json>

To build a debug version of the application:

    kprconfig6 -d -x -m -p <platform> <path-to-manifest.json>

Where <`platform`> is one of: mac, ios, android, linux/aspen (for Kinoma Create), linux/gtk, or win.

The package created by the build is located in **${F_HOME}/bin/`<platform>`/`<build-type>`/<app-name>.tgz** (or **.app**, **.ipa**, **.apk**, etc. depending on target platform).

* * *

Use **-clean** to clean the target application and platform. 

    kprconfig6 -x -m -p <platform> <path-to-manifest.json> -clean

Use **-cleanall** to clean all applications and all platforms.

    kprconfig6 -cleanall


## kprconfig6 Options

### General Options
- **-a**: application name
- **-p**: platform name
- **-v**: verbose
- **-clean**: clean the build for a particular application/platform
- **-cleanall**: clean the build for all platforms/applications

### Debug Options
- **-c**: debug or release configuration
- **-d**: debug build *(same as "-c debug")*
- **-i**: enable instrumentation
- **-l**: debug memory leaks
- **-X**: support xsdebug

### Build Options
- **-I**: use the CMake generated IDE *(sets -x)*
- **-g**: sets CMake generator (build tool used)
- **-m**: build the application after generating the make files
- **-x**: use CMake build

### iOS Options
- **-csi**: code signing identity to use on iOS
- **-pp**: provisioning profile for iOS

### Output Options
- **-b**: bin directory
- **-o**: output directory to place default bin and tmp directories
- **-t**: tmp directory

# Mac OS X Target

![icon](http://kinoma.com/img/github/osx.png)

Building KinomaJS for Mac OS X uses a computer running Mac OS X as the build host.

On Mac OS X, the KinomaJS build uses **Homebrew** to manage installation and maintenance of **CMake**.

### Set-up your host build environment

1. Install the current version of **Xcode** from Apple's App Store. *(As of the writing of this document, that is version 7.2)* After installing, run Xcode to accept the license agreement and install any required additional components.

2. Install Homebrew ([http://brew.sh/](http://brew.sh/))

        $ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
        $ brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask

3. Install CMake

        $ brew install cmake

4. Get a copy of the KinomaJS source code. It can be downloaded using your web browser from the [KinomaJS repository on GitHub](http://github.org/kinoma/kinomajs) or using the git command line tool:

        $ git clone https://github.com/kinoma/kinomajs.git

5. Set up two environment variables to point to the source tree.

        $ export F_HOME=/path/to/kinomajs
        $ export XS6=${F_HOME}/xs6
        
### Build the XS6 tools

        $ cd ${XS6}
        $ mkdir tmp
        $ cd tmp
        $ cmake ${XS6}
        $ cmake --build . --config Release

Update the **PATH** environment variable to include the path to the XS6 tools:

        $ export PATH=${PATH}:${XS6}/bin/mac/Release
        
*Optional*: Build **xsbug**, a graphical debugger used as an alternative to the Kinoma Studio debugger.

        $ kprconfig6 -p mac -x -m ${XS6}/xsbug/manifest.json

The xsbug application is located at `${F_HOME}/bin/mac/Release/xsbug.app`

### Build your KinomaJS Application
