# KinomaJS JavaScript Reference

## About This Document

This document provides details on the objects that define the KinomaJS API. The companion document [*KinomaJS Overview*](../overview/) introduces KinomaJS along with much more information that this document assumes you are already familiar with (including a Glossary of terms used in this document).

## Inheritance Hierarchy

Figure 1 summarizes the inheritance hierarchy for the objects described in this document. The `content` objects (leaves of the containment hierarchy) are shown in light gray, the `container` objects (branches of the containment hierarchy) in gray, and the `application` and `shell` objects (roots of the containment hierarchy) in dark gray.

> The current touch samples, as an object with properties indexed by touch identifier. Each property is an array of samples, where each sample is an object with `x`, `y`, and `ticks` number properties corresponding to the most recent global position and time. To avoid overwhelming the application with events, the `onTouchMoved` event is not triggered on each touch point change. Touch move events are typically limited to the display refresh rate--for example, 60 times a second. To access any touch samples that occur between `onTouchMoved` events, behaviors use the `touches` global property.

<!--From CR: Example below (and maybe some of the details above) should be moved out of this Ref doc into the Overview doc.-->

```
function onTouchMoved(content, id, x, y, ticks) {
	var samples = touches[id];
	var sample = samples[samples.length - 1];
	// x == sample.x;
	// y == sample.y;
	// ticks == sample.ticks;
}
```

## KinomaJS Object Reference
This section provides details on the objects that define the KinomaJS API. For each object, the following information is presented if relevant:

- **Coordinates** -- For `content` objects only; details regarding how the object uses its coordinates for layout

- **Object Description** -- Descriptions of the object's value properties and function properties; also, for the global `application` and `shell` objects, an indication of the prototype from which the object inherits and whether the object is sealed and/or volatile

- **Constructor Description** -- A description of the object's constructor(s)

- **Dictionary** -- Present when additional information is needed regarding the dictionary passed to the object's dictionary-based constructor; describes the properties that the dictionary may contain. Dictionary parameters set properties having the same name (unless noted otherwise) in the created instance.

- **Prototype Description** -- The prototype from which this object's prototype inherits; whether instances of the object are sealed and/or volatile; and descriptions of any properties specific to this object's prototype

<!--From CR re the following: Currently no event returns a value. If that changes, event descriptions may end in a "Returns:" line and the following will be restored here: "If a return value is indicated, it is required unless noted otherwise."-->

- **Events** -- Descriptions of the events that the object triggers

The following conventions are used in this section:

* **Default values** -- Value properties or parameters that are required are indicated as such. Unless noted otherwise, the default values for properties or parameters are 0, `false`, and `undefined` for types `number`, `boolean`, and `string`, respectively.
   
* **Pixels** -- Most properties or parameters that designate pixels are in logical pixels. The descriptions explicitly mention when such numbers are in physical pixels.
   
* **"read only"** -- All properties defined by KinomaJS can be read, but only some can be set; properties that cannot be set are designated as "read only."
   
* **"this"** -- In property descriptions, "this" followed by a reference to the type of object under discussion (for example, "this container" in the "Container Object" section) refers to the object of that type that owns or inherits the property being accessed.

>**Note:** This reference section refers to chunks, but use of chunks has been deprecated.


### Application Object

Applications run in their own virtual machine. When the shell creates a `host` object, the runtime creates a virtual machine and its `application` object and then executes the application's main script, specified by the `url` parameter of the `Host` constructor. The application's main script usually assigns a behavior to the `application` object and builds a containment hierarchy.

#### Coordinates

The `application` object always has the position and size of the `host` object that hosts the application.

#### Object Description

Object inherits from `Container.prototype`.

Object is sealed.

#####`application`

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `application` | `object` | read only |

> For application scripts, there is only one `application` object, which is the value of the `application` global property and is the root of the containment hierarchy.

> For shell scripts, there is no `application` object; the value of the `application` global property is `null`.

#####`application.di`

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `application.di` | `string` | read only |

> This application's reverse identifier--for example, `com.kinoma.guide`

<!--From Peter re the following: Overview doc needs to introduce discovery and give an example of `type`.-->

#####`application.discover(type)`

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | `string` | required |

> The type of services to discover on the local network

Causes this application to trigger `onDiscovered` events when KinomaJS signals that services of the specified type have appeared or disappeared on the network.

#####`application.forget(type)`

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | `string` | required |

> The type of services to discover on the local network

Causes this application not to trigger `onDiscovered` events when KinomaJS signals that services of the specified type have appeared or disappeared on the network

#####`application.id`

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `application.id` | `string` | read only |

> This application's identifier--for example, `guide.kinoma.com`. It is used as the authority in a URL with the `xkpr` scheme.

#####`application.purge()`

Garbage-collects the virtual machine of this application

#####`application.shared`

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `application.shared` | `boolean` | |

<!--From Peter: The following info deleted here should be covered in the Overview doc:

The service uses SSDP to advertise its location, type, and UUID, and uses an HTTP server to dispatch messages to handler objects (or, if no handlers match, to the application object).-->

> If `true`, this application is shared as a service on the network. Set to `true` or `false` to turn the service on or off.

#####`application.url`

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `application.url` | `string` | read only |

> The URL of this application's main script

#####`application.uuid`

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `application.uuid` | `string` | read only |
 
> This application's persistent universal unique identifier (UUID). KinomaJS automatically creates this value the first time an application is launched on a given device.

#### Events

Same as for `container` object (see [Events](#container-object-events) in the section [Container Object](#container-object)), plus:

#####`onDiscovered(services)`

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `services` | `object` | |

> The currently available services, as an array of objects with `location`, `type`, and `uuid` string properties

This event is triggered when KinomaJS determines that services the `application` object has requested to discover have appeared or disappeared on the network.

#####`onInvoke(application, message)`

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `application` | `object` | |

> The `application` object

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `message` | `object` | |

> The received `message` object

This event is triggered when the application receives a message that does not match any of its handlers.

#####`onLaunch(application)`

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `application` | `object` | |

> The `application` object

This event is triggered when the shell calls the `launch` function of the `host` object that hosts the application.

#####`onQuit(application)`

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `application` | `object` | |

> The `application` object

This event is triggered when the shell calls the `quit` function of the `host` object that hosts the application.

### Behavior Object

The `behavior` object contains functions corresponding to events triggered by a `content` or `handler` object. A `content` or `handler` object checks whether its behavior, which can be any object, owns or inherits a function property with the name of the event, and if so calls that function, passing itself as the first parameter.

#### Constructor Description

<!--From CR: I've assumed that the following applies to all the constructors below; correct?-->

These constructors are provided only to trigger the `onCreate` event; applications and shells can define their own constructors for `behavior` objects.

<!--From CR: Please verify that ALL constructor parameters (below AND THROUGHOUT) are marked "required" that should be.

Patrick replied: "The dictionary parameter is required for Behavior and Behavior.template." I've made those changes below, but is `Behavior` really the only object for which the dictionary is required? (It's not shown as required anywhere else.)-->

<!--From CR: Please also review `Handler.bind(path, behavior)`-->

#####`Behavior(dictionary)`

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dictionary` | `object` | required |

> An object with properties to initialize the result

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |

> A `behavior` instance, an object that inherits from `Behavior.prototype`

#####`Behavior(trigger, ...)`

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `trigger` | `object` | required |

> The `content` or `handler` object that will reference the result

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `...` | `*` | |

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |

#####`Behavior.template(dictionary)`

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dictionary` | `object` | required |

> An object with properties to initialize the prototype of the result

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Returns | `function` | |

> A constructor that creates instances of a prototype that inherits from `Behavior.prototype`. The result can also be used as a dictionary-based constructor and provides a `template` function.

#### Prototype Description

Prototype inherits from `Object.prototype`.

#####`Behavior.prototype.onCreate(trigger, ...)`

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `trigger` | `object` | required |

> The `content` or `handler` object that will reference the result

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `...` | `*` | |

> Zero or more extra parameters

The parameters of the `onCreate` event are the parameters of the `Behavior` constructor. This function does nothing by default; a behavior can use it to initialize its properties, for example.

### Canvas Object

The `canvas` object is a `content` object that delegates drawing to a script in its behavior that draws using the HTML 2D Canvas API specified by the W3C. It provides a 2D context conforming to the [HTML Canvas 2D Context specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/) (which defines the `2d` context type, whose API is implemented using the `CanvasRenderingContext2D` interface).

#### Coordinates

The measured width and measured height of a `canvas` object are 0.

#### Constructor Description

#####`Canvas(dictionary)`

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dictionary` | `object` | |

> An object with properties to initialize the result. The dictionary is the same as for the `content` object (see [Dictionary](#content-dictionary) in the section [Content Object](#content-object)).

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |

| `id` | `string` | required |

> The identifier of the rendering context; must be `2d`

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Returns | `object` | |

> A 2D rendering context, an object that conforms to the `CanvasRenderingContext2D` interface except that the `image` parameter of the `createPattern` and `drawImage` functions must be a `canvas`, `picture`, or `texture` instance

#### Events

Same as for `content` object (see [Events](#content-object-events) in the section [Content Object](#content-object))

### Column Object

The `column` object is a `container` object that arranges its contents vertically.

#### Coordinates

The measured height of a `column` object is the sum of the vertical extents of its contents.

The `top` and `bottom` coordinates of the column's contents are treated as vertical gaps between the contents.

The column distributes the difference between its fitted height and its measured height among its contents according to their `top` and `bottom` coordinates.

Horizontally, a `column` object measures itself and arranges its contents like a `container` object (see [Coordinates](#container-object-coordinates) in the section [Container Object](#container-object)).

#### Constructor Description

#####`Column(dictionary)`

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dictionary` | `object` | |

> An object with properties to initialize the result. The dictionary is the same as for the `container` object (see [Dictionary](#container-dictionary) in the section [Container Object](#container-object)).

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Returns | `object` | |

> A `column` instance, an object that inherits from `Column.prototype`

#####`Column(coordinates, skin, style)`

| | | |

| `anonymous` | `function` | |

> A function that returns an object with properties to initialize the instances that the result creates

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Returns | `function` | |

> A constructor that creates instances of `Column.prototype`. The `prototype` property of the result is `Column.prototype`. The result also provides a `template` function.

#### Prototype Description

Prototype inherits from `Container.prototype`.

Instances are sealed and volatile.

#### Events

Same as for `container` object (see [Events](#container-object-events) in the section [Container Object](#container-object))

<a id="container-object"></a>
### Container Object

The `container` object is a `content` object that can contain other `content` objects. In a container, `content` objects are stored in a doubly linked list. The `content` objects can also be accessed by index or by name using JavaScript bracket notation.

<a id="container-object-coordinates"></a>
#### Coordinates

The measured width of a `container` object is the maximum horizontal extent of its contents.

Horizontally, a `container` object arranges its contents according to their `left` and `right` coordinates:

* If both are defined, the content stretches horizontally with the container. The fitted width of the content equals the fitted width of the container minus the value of the content's `left` and `right` coordinates.

* If only `left` is defined, the content sticks to the left of the container.

* If only `right` is defined, the content sticks to the right of the container.

* If both are undefined, the content sticks to the horizontal center of the container.

The measured height of a `container` object is the maximum vertical extent of its contents.

Vertically, a `container` object arranges its content s according to their `top` and `bottom` coordinates:

* If both are defined, the content stretches vertically with the container. The fitted height of the content equals the fitted height of the container minus the value of the content's `top` and `bottom` coordinates.

* If only `top` is defined, the content sticks to the top of the container.

* If only `bottom` is defined, the content sticks to the bottom of the container.

* If both are undefined, the content sticks to the vertical middle of the container.

#### Constructor Description

#####`Container(dictionary)`

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dictionary` | `object` | |

> An object with properties to initialize the result (see [Dictionary](#container-dictionary) below for details)

| | | |

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `style` | `object` | |

> The style of the result, as a `style` instance

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Returns | `object` | |

> A `container` instance, an object that inherits from `Container.prototype`

#####`Container.template(anonymous)`

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `anonymous` | `function` | |

> A function that returns an object with properties to initialize the instances that the result creates

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Returns | `function` | |

> A constructor that creates instances of `Container.prototype`. The `prototype` property of the result is `Container.prototype`. The result also provides a `template` function.

<a id="container-dictionary"></a>
#### Dictionary

Same as for `content` object (see [Dictionary](#content-dictionary) in the section [Content Object](#content-object)), plus:

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `backgroundTouch` | `boolean` | |

> If `true`, this container receives any touch events that are received by its contents; that is, it will trigger touch events when one of its contents has been touched.

<!--From CR re the following: Nothing is said anywhere else about clipping (and Mike has commented that he thinks more info is needed)--perhaps cover it in the Overview doc?-->

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `clip` | `boolean` | |

> If `true`, this container clips its contents.

<!--From CR: Is there a technical reason that an array of objects is type `array` in a dictionary (such as below) but type `object` for properties/parameters in all other contexts (such as for onDiscovered)?

Also, the type in the second column should not be in the code font if being used as a generic term; please advise if any should be changed. The current types that appear there are `number`, `boolean`, `string`, `object`, and (new in this draft) `function` and 'array`.-->

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `contents` | `array` | |

> An array of the `content` objects in this container

#### Prototype Description

Prototype inherits from `Content.prototype`.

Instances are sealed and volatile.

#####`Container.prototype.add(content)`

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `content` | `object` | required |

> The `content` object to add. It must be unbound; that is, its container must be `null`.

#####`Container.prototype.backgroundTouch`

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Container.prototype.backgroundTouch` | `boolean` | |

> If `true`, this container also receives any touch events that are received by its contents; that is, it will trigger touch events when one of its contents has been touched. If the container or any of its contents captures the touch events (by calling `captureTouch`), touch events will be delivered exclusively to the capturing object until after the corresponding `onTouchEnded` event is triggered.

#####`Container.prototype.clip`

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Container.prototype.clip` | `boolean` | |

> If `true`, this container clips its contents.

#####`Container.prototype.distribute(id, ...)`

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `string` | required |

> The name of the event to trigger

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `...` | `*` | |

> Zero or more extra parameters

Causes this container and all `content` objects downward in the containment hierarchy to trigger an event named by the value of `id`. The order of traversal is depth first. Traversal halts when one of the triggered event-handling functions returns `true`. Note that the first parameter of a distributed event is the `content` object that triggers the event, not this container. Additional parameters, if any, of the event are the extra parameters of the `distribute` function.

#####`Container.prototype.empty(start, stop)`

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `start` | `number` | |

> The starting index

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `stop` | `number` | |

> The stopping index (`this.length` by default)

Removes `content` objects from this container, starting at index `start` and stopping at index `stop`. If `start` or `stop` is less than 0, it is an offset from `this.length`.

#####`Container.prototype.first`

#####`Container.prototype.firstThat(id, ...)`

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `string` | required |

> The name of the event to trigger

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `...` | `*` | |

> Zero or more extra parameters

Causes all `content` objects in this container to trigger an event named by the value of `id`. The order of traversal is from the first to the last. Traversal halts when a distributed event returns `true`. Note that the first parameter of a distributed event is the `content` object that triggers the event, not this container. Additional parameters, if any, of the event are the extra parameters of the `firstThat` function.

#####`Container.prototype.insert(content, before)`

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `content` | `object` | required |

> The `content` object to insert. Its container must be `null`.

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `before` | `object` | required |

> The `content` object before which to insert. Its container must be this container.

Inserts one `content` object before another in this container as specified by the parameters

#####`Container.prototype.last`

#####`Container.prototype.lastThat(id, ...)`

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `string` | required |

> The name of the event to trigger

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `...` | `*` | |

> Zero or more extra parameters

Causes all `content` objects in this container to trigger an event named by the value of `id`. The order of traversal is from the last to the first. Traversal halts when a distributed event returns `true`. Note that the first parameter of a distributed event is the `content` object that triggers the event, not this container. Additional parameters, if any, of the event are the extra parameters of the `lastThat` function.

#####`Container.prototype.length`

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Container.prototype.length` |`number` | read only |

> The number of `content` objects in this container

#####`Container.prototype.remove(content)`

### Layer Object

The `layer` object is a `container` object that caches its contents in a bitmap. It is commonly used by transitions to temporarily cache and animate parts of the containment hierarchy.

The `layer` object has a transformation matrix that is computed from its properties in the following order: origin, corners projection, scale, rotation, skew, and translation.

#### Events

Same as for `container` object (see [Events](#container-object-events) in the section [Container Object](#container-object)).

### Layout Object

The `layout` object is a `container` object that delegates positioning and sizing of its contents to a script in its behavior.

#### Coordinates

When its width is measured, the `layout` object triggers the `onMeasureHorizontally` event, and the behavior can modify the measured width of the `layout` object or the coordinates of its contents. If its behavior does not handle the `onMeasureHorizontally` event, the `layout` object works horizontally like a container (see [Coordinates](#container-object-coordinates) in the section [Container Object](#container-object)).

When its height is measured, the `layout` object triggers the `onMeasureVertically` event, and the behavior can modify the measured height of the `layout` object or the coordinates of its contents. If its behavior does not handle the `onMeasureVertically` event, the `layout` object works vertically like a container (see [Coordinates](#container-object-coordinates) in the section [Container Object](#container-object)).

<!--From CR: Mike Jennings would like to see `line` aliased as `row`; he says `line` confuses newbies. Please consider and either incorporate result(here and in the other core KinomaJS docs) or delete this comment.-->

### Line Object

The `line` object is a `container` object that arranges its contents horizontally.

#### Coordinates

The measured width of a `line` object is the sum of the horizontal extents of its contents.

The `left` and `right` coordinates of the line's contents are treated as horizontal gaps between the contents.

The line distributes the difference between its fitted width and its measured width among its contents according to their `left` and `right` coordinates.

Vertically, a `line` object measures itself and arranges its contents like a `container` object (see [Coordinates](#container-object-coordinates) in the section [Container Object](#container-object)).

The stream is referenced by a URL, which commonly uses the `file`, `http`, or `https` scheme. Applications sometimes use a URL with the `xkpr` scheme, which redirects to a URL for the media data after applying application logic.

#### Coordinates

The measured width and measured height of a `media` object are the width and height of the object's audio or video stream. For audio, the width and height of the album art's image are used.

<!--From CR: The `media` object has no `mime` property per se (according to the next section), so what does this set in the created instance? (Ditto later for `picture` object)

Patrick's reply: The MIME property is a hint for the media object to select a codec to play audio/video, for instance “audio/mp3” is a hint to use the MP3 codec. It is only an optional hint because the media object can often check the data to select a codec.

His reply implies that there is in fact a `mime` property, so should it be added in the next section? (Ditto for `picture` object.)-->

Messages support the standard `file`, `http`, and `https` schemes to access files and web services. The default scheme, `xkpr`, enables applications and shells to use `message` objects to communicate with each other and to deliver messages to themselves. The default authority is the identifier of the application or shell in which the message is created.

### Picture Object

The `picture` object is a `content` object that displays images referenced by a URL with the standard `file`, `http`, or `https` scheme. For a URL with the `xkpr` scheme, the behavior of the corresponding `handler` object must redirect to a URL with one of the standard schemes.

The `picture` object has a transformation matrix that is computed from its properties in the following order: origin, corners projection, scale, rotation, skew, and translation.

### Port Object

The `port` object is a `content` object that delegates drawing to a script in its behavior that draws using simple KinomaJS graphics commands.

The `port` object has a clip rectangle (initially the bounds of the `port` object) and an opacity that affect all drawing, and a transformation matrix that affects drawing of images. The transformation matrix is computed from the port's properties in the following order: origin, corners projection, scale, rotation, skew, and translation.

Note that when `picture` or `texture` instances are used to render images in a `port` object, the `port` object uses only the pixels of the image, ignoring most properties of those instances, including their crop, opacity, scale, and transformation matrix.

### Shell Object

Shells run in their own virtual machine. The manifest that configures a project specifies a URL for the shell's main script. When launched, the runtime creates a virtual machine and its `shell` object and then executes the shell's main script, which usually assigns a behavior to the `shell` object and builds a containment hierarchy.

<!--From ￼Peter re the following paragraph: Revisit this terminology after completing the corresponding section in the Overview-->

Most manifests specify two main scripts for shells: one for the device shell (the shell used to profile and run the project on the device itself) and one for the desktop mockup shell (the shell used to develop and debug the project on Mac OS or Windows).

#### Coordinates

The `shell` object always has the size of the display screen (device shell) and the size of the window (desktop mockup shell). The position of the `shell` object is always `{ x:0, y:0 }`.

#### Object Description

Object inherits from `Container.prototype`.

Object is sealed.

### Text Object

The `text` object is a `content` object that renders a string on multiple lines with multiple styles. There are three ways to modify the string of a `text` object. An application typically uses only one of these approaches for a specific `text` object.

* Set the `string` property. This replaces the full string.

* Set selection of the `text` object using the `select` function and using the `insert` function to add characters. This replaces the selected part of the string.

* Build the string with blocks and spans, between calls to the `begin` and `end` functions. This appends characters to the string. This method provides the most control, since each span can have a different style.

#### Coordinates

The measured width of a `text` object is 0\. The measured height is the height of the `text` object's string rendered with its style in the fitted width of the `text` object.
