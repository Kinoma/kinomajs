## About Kinoma Create

The most important thing to know about Kinoma Create (shown in Figures 1 and 2) is that it is primarily a 3.3-volt system. If you are new to 3.3V systems or to hardware in general, this means that (unlike with an Arduino or some other boards), you can only send up to 3.3 volts into input pins on the device without doing damage to the pin. The exception to this is the front pins, which can be set to either 3.3V or 5V mode. When in 5V mode, it is safe to input up to 5V into those pins.

Download [Kinoma Code](http://kinoma.com/develop/code/). You can try out your own applications in our desktop simulator, build apps for iOS and Android, or run any of our samples (included with Kinoma Code) on your Kinoma Create.

The Kinoma team is ready to support you as you work with your Kinoma Create. The best way to get answers to your questions is to post on the corresponding [Kinoma Forum](http://forum.kinoma.com/).

We want you all to successfully bring your product concepts to life, and we will be here to help you along the way. Enjoy your Kinoma Create!


## Kinoma Create First Run

Take these steps to get going on your Kinoma Create for the first time:

1. Remove the back cover and install the battery.

   ![](img/firstRun01.png)

2. Begin charging the device with the supplied charger. 

   **Note:** Kinoma Create has specific requirements for the charging block and cable. Using charging systems other than the one supplied with Kinoma Create may not charge the battery.

   ![](img/firstRun02.png)

3. Press the power button on the back of your Kinoma Create. Kinoma Create typically takes 35 seconds to boot.

   ![](img/firstRun03.png)

4. Use the Wi-Fi app to add your Kinoma Create to your network.

   ![](img/firstRun04.png)

5. Use the Settings app to set the time zone.

   ![](img/firstRun05.png)


## Powering Up/Down and Sleep

Once you have started up your Kinoma Create (by pressing the power button and waiting about 35 seconds), a short press will display a menu enabling you to shut down the device, enter sleep mode, or return to the shell (Home), as shown in Figure 3. Also note the reset button on the device; use a paper clip (or similar) to reach it if you need to perform a hard reset.

**Figure 3.** Power and Reset Buttons and Power Button Menu  

![](img/shutdown-sleep.png)

If the device is in sleep mode, a short press will wake it up.


## Charging the Internal Battery
Kinoma Create uses a 3.7V, 2600 mAh, Li-ion battery. The battery style is 18650.

Kinoma Create has specific requirements for the charging block and cable. Using charging systems other than the one supplied with Kinoma Create may not charge the battery. The battery power graph is calibrated to the included Tenergy battery.

## Setting Up a Bootable SD Card

You can install an SD card and set it up as a bootable volume. As part of the setup process, the latest Kinoma Create system image will download. Once you have created a bootable SD card, you can boot from the SD card and update the firmware on your Kinoma Create. 

**_Important:_** Formatting an SD card as a bootable volume completely erases the contents of the SD card being prepared.

Figure 9 shows the initial screen for **Set Up SD Card** and the screen displayed after you select **Update SD Card**; you will then see a toggle to start from a bootable SD card if present.

**Figure 9.** Set Up SD Card Utility

## Connecting to a PC

You can connect your Kinoma Create to your PC, via either Micro-USB or Mini-USB, to power it.

If you connect via the Mini-USB port, you can access the serial console. [FTDI drivers](http://www.ftdichip.com/FTDrivers.htm) are required for serial connections over USB.

## Using Hardware Pins

The front and back hardware pins are introduced here; for details on coding with these pins, see the document [_Programming with Hardware Pins for Kinoma Create_](../pins/).


### Front Pins

The 16 pins on the front-facing header can be targeted by the Front Pins app to support Digital, Analog In, and I<sup>2</sup>C connections. Power can be supplied at 3.3 or 5 volts. Input pins will handle up to 3.3V. The front pins are designed to conveniently fit readily available sensors mounted on breakout boards.

To access the front pins, press up on the sensor cover with your thumbs while holding onto the sides of Kinoma Create.
